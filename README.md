# Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This repository implements a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for European cities. Developed as part of a university assignment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to run the algorithm.
- `functions.py`: Contains helper functions for genetic operations.
- `worldcities.csv`: Dataset of European city coordinates.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. Run the algorithm:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
